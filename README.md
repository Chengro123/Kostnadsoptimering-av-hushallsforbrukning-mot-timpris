This is the result of a bachelor's thesis at Chalmers University of Technology, with the aim of cost-optimizing the electricity consumption of an air heat pump and a water heater against an hourly rate. The implementation takes place in Home Assistant's subsystem AppDaemon. Instructions for applying the optimization code for your air heat pump and/or water heater follows below.

Please note that there might be some swedish left from the original installation. We hope to have everything translated to english soon, but until then two common abbreviations used are LVP for air heat pump or "luftvÃ¤rmepump" and VVB for water heater or "varmvattenberedare". This how-to page does not go into how Home Assistant or AppDaemon works, but only aims to explain the installation and configuration steps to get the optimizations working. Also note that your products may not be compatible with the methods we use, e.g. Huskoll (more on this later) for controlling the air heat pump. Hopefully you can then find a similar method that can be easily integrated into the optimization.

# What's needed to start?
- A computer/single-board computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi) to run Home Assistant OS with access to the internet.
## What's needed for the water heater?
- A smart plug/some way to control the on/off state of the heater.
- Temperature sensors to measure the water temperature on different height in the tank. We used four sensors and put them against the outside of the tank by drilling holes in the surrounding styrofoam.
## What's needed for the air heat pump?
- Some way to control the set temperature for the air heat pump, we used the swedish invention [Huskoll](https://huskoll.se/).
## Extras than can be used to improve the air heat pump optimization
- Sensors for inside temperature.
- Ampere meter to measure the used energy for the air heat pump.

# Installation
To increase readability and ease of use, we recommend to put all sensor-, input number- and script-configurations in separate files by adding e.g.
```yaml
sensor: !include sensors.yaml
input_number: !include input_numbers.yaml
```
in `configuration.yaml`.

## Nord Pool
Configure the Home Assistant's Nord Pool integration and add it to `sensors.yaml` as
```yaml
- platform: nordpool
  VAT: true
  currency: "SEK"
  region: "SE3"
  precision: 3
  price_type: kWh
```
remember to change the parameters for your location and preferred currency.

## Water heater
In `input_numbers.yaml` add
```yaml
vvb_test:
  name: vvb status for testing 
  min: 0
  max: 1
```
and in `sensors.yaml` add
```yaml
- platform: template
  sensors:
    t_vvb_1:
      friendly_name: vvb 1
      value_template: >-
        {% set t_tmp = states('sensor.vvbsensor_1') | float %}
        {{t_tmp+(t_tmp-20)/(45-20)*10}}
      unit_of_measurement: "deg C"
    t_vvb_2:
      friendly_name: vvb 2
      value_template: >-
        {% set t_tmp = states('sensor.vvbsensor_4') | float %}
        {{t_tmp+(t_tmp-20)/(45-20)*10}}
      unit_of_measurement: "deg C"
    t_vvb_3:
      friendly_name: vvb 3
      value_template: >-
        {% set t_tmp = states('sensor.vvbsensor_2') | float %}
        {{t_tmp+(t_tmp-20)/(45-20)*10}}
      unit_of_measurement: "deg C"
    t_vvb_4:
      friendly_name: vvb 4
      value_template: >-
        {% set t_tmp = states('sensor.vvbsensor_3') | float %}
        {{t_tmp+(t_tmp-20)/(45-20)*10}}
      unit_of_measurement: "deg C"
    vvb_energy_to_full:
      friendly_name: Energy to Full
      value_template: >-
        {% set t1 = states('sensor.t_vvb_1') | float %}
        {% set t2 = states('sensor.t_vvb_2') | float %}
        {% set t3 = states('sensor.t_vvb_3') | float %}
        {% set t4 = states('sensor.t_vvb_4') | float %}
        {{ 
        (((max(0,(60-t1)) + max(0,(56-t2)) + max(0,(54-t3)) + max(0,(58-t4))) / 4)*300*4.18/3600)
        }}
      unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
    vvb_soc:
      friendly_name: VVB SOC
      value_template: >-
        {% set t1 = states('sensor.t_vvb_1') | float %}
        {% set t2 = states('sensor.t_vvb_2') | float %}
        {% set t3 = states('sensor.t_vvb_3') | float %}
        {% set t4 = states('sensor.t_vvb_4') | float %}
        {{
        (((max(0, t1-30) + max(0,t2-30) + max(0, t3-30) + max(0, t4-30)) / 4 / (67-30))*100) | round(2)}}
      unit_of_measurement: "percent"
```
Also create three input booleans
```yaml
input_boolean:
  vvb_button1: 
  vvb_button2:
  vvb_model:
```
and two input texts:
```yaml
input_boolean:
  vvb_information1: 
  vvb_information2:
```
Lastly create a .json-file named ```saved_vvb_times.json``` in the logs-folder (full path ```/config/appdaemon/logs/saved_vvb_times.json```). This is where the runtimes for the water heater are saved.

## Air heat pump
Two input booleans
```yaml
input_boolean:
  toggle_lvp_optimizer:
    initial: true
  toggle_include_comftemp:
    initial: true
```
four input numbers
```yaml
mintemp:
   name: Minimum comfort temperature during expensive electricity prices
   initial: 18
   step: 1
   min: 8 # Minimum value that Huskoll allows
   max: 32 # Maximum value that Huskoll allows
maxtemp:
   name: Highest comfort temperature during cheap electricity prices
   initial: 23
   step: 1
   min: 8 # Minimum value that Huskoll allows
   max: 32 # Maximum value that Huskoll allows
comforttemp:
   name: Standard comfort temperature during normal electricity prices
   initial: 20
   step: 1
   min: 8 # Minimum value that Huskoll allows
   max: 32 # Maximum value that Huskoll allows
cooling_constant:
   name: Cooldown constant
   initial: 0.04
   steps: 0.01
   min: 0.01
   max: 0.1
```
and one sensor
```yaml
- platform: template
  sensors:
    setpoints:
      friendly_name: The air heat pump's set temperatures
      value_template: "."

```
has to be created, together with the file (```/config/appdaemon/logs/saved_setpoints.json```) to store needed data. The main purpose of this is to avoid crashes if data can not be read from its original source.

To fully make the automation work, a weather forecast will also be needed. This is used to approximate how long it takes the house to reach minimum temperature. Now only the outside temperature is taken into consideration by using [Newton's law of cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_cooling), but this can be further developed to include other properties that change the cooling of the house, such as humidity, wind speed and cloudiness.
We used [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and a [RESTful Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/sensor.rest/) to import the forecast to HA. The reason to use a REST sensor instead of e.g. making an API-call in the code is to reduce calls if the code is ran often.

```yaml
- platform: rest
  resource: !secret weatherapiresource
  method: POST
  name: "Weather data via API"
  scan_interval: !secret scanInt
  value_template: "1" # dummy value, not used; avoids the "State max length is 255 characters" error
  json_attributes:
    - "location"
    - "current"
    - "forecast"
  force_update: True
```

To make this work, add the required fields (in our version only "temp_c" under "Hour" has to be marked) on https://www.weatherapi.com/my/fields.aspx and in `secrets.yaml`, add the resource and the scan interval (how often the sensor should do an API-call to recieve new data) as
```yaml
scanInt: 900
weatherapiresource: https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=YOURKEY&q=YOURCITY&days=3&aqi=no&alerts=no
```
We use 900 s as scan interval (every quarter), which correspond to 96 calls per day and ~3000 calls per month (1 M free calls). The resource can either be generated in WeatherAPI's [API Explorer](https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx) or by filling in your key and location in the URL above.

## Temperature sensors and ampere meter for the air heat pump
To include temperature sensors in the optimization (recommended), used to measure the inside temperature (preferably some distance away from the air heat pump), follow the steps below.

We used ESPHome to set up the four sensors and gave them names ```sensor.testsensor_i``` for ```i = 1,2,3,4```. From these a YAML-sensor with their mean value was set up as
```yaml
- platform: template
  sensors:
    temp_average_inside:
      friendly_name: Temp average inside
      value_template: >-
        {% set temp_average_inside = (
        states('sensor.testsensor_1') | float +
        states('sensor.testsensor_2') | float +
        states('sensor.testsensor_3') | float +
        states('sensor.testsensor_4') | float ) / 4
        %}
        {{temp_average_inside}}
      unit_of_measurement: "deg C"
```
To improve the estimated energy for the air heat pump, another code saves the mean used power each hour in a file ```/config/appdaemon/logs/db_settemps.json```. A barebone version of this file lies in the folder ```lvp```.


# Configuration
Insert the code in the folders lvp and vvb into the Appdaemon "apps"-folder in Home Assistant, except ```db_settemps.json```, which should lie in the ```logs```-folder (```/config/appdaemon/logs/db_settemps.json```). Configure the AppDaemon "apps"-file as:
```yaml
lvp_controller:
  module: controlLVP
  class: lvpControl
  log: lvp_control_log
  lvp_token: !secret lvp_token
  lvp_hwid: !secret lvp_hwid
vvb_code:
  module: vvb
  class: VVBCode
  log: vvb_log
mlpower:
  module: ml_power
  class: calculatePower
  log: mlpower_log
```
Remeber to create the log-files and configure them in `appdaemon.yaml` as e.g.
```yaml
  lvp_control_log:
    name: LVPStyrLogg
    filename: /config/appdaemon/logs/lvp_control.log
```
If secrets is not enabled, add
```yaml
secrets: /config/secrets.yaml
```
to the top of `appdaemon.yaml` and in `secrets.yaml` add
```yaml
lvp_token: 'YOURTOKEN'
lvp_hwid: 'YOURKEY'
```

For the water heater, change the variable ```python self.POWER = 3 # kW ``` to correspond to the power your water heater has.

If the ```ml_power.py```-program is used, change ```self.pwr_id = 'sensor.shelly_em3_channel_a_energy'``` to correspond to your sensor that shows used energy for the air heat pump.

As wrote above, we use Huskoll to control the air heat pump. If you use another program, you will have to change the `set_lvp_state()` and `get_lvp_state()` - functions in `controlLVP.py`. Another change in this file are the [COP-values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_performance) for the pump. Check with your manufacturer for your numbers, you should have two lists of values; one list with temperatures, and one list with the COP-values corresponding to the temperatures. These will then be interpolated by the code to adjust the electricity price with the efficiency of the air source heat pump for that day's outdoor temperature.
